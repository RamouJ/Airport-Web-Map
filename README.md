# Airports in the United States

## Description

This interactive web app is a choropleth map based on the number of airports within each state. There are also markers signifiying whether or not each airport is equipped with a cell tower. 

## Data Sources and Acknowledgments

The United States geographic data used to create the choropleth map, was acquired from Mike Bostock of D3. The shapefile used to present the airport data was gathered from data.gov. The lab which I refrenced and built this map off of was originally designed in the context of Oregon, and was made available through my enrollment in the GEOG 458 course taught by Bo Zhao in the department of GIS at the University of Washington.

## Libraries and Functions 

Firstly, the base map was added to the map object using the `L.titleLayer` function from the **Leaflet** library within **javaScript**.
